# Meta Learning Based Multimodal Fake News Detection

## Description

Welcome to our project! This consists of two meta learning models (MAML and CAVIA) used for classifying Fake News into six different labels using CLIP embeddings of images and text. This is an efficient way to combat the widespread dissemination of misinformation & prevent easy manipulation of people.
